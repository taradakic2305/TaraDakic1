**Hi, I’m Tara Dakić! 👋**
I’m currently learning Git and version control through HWB, exploring repos, branches, and pull requests.
I played Division 1 tennis 🎾, earned my Bachelor’s in Finance from Wagner College, and… honestly, I’m just figuring things out as I go 😅.

##Fun fact
I love finance and strategic projects, and I enjoy learning new skills while building my skills! 🚀
I used to work in real estate finance and now im persuing a degree in economics to expand my knowledge
